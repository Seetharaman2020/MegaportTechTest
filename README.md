# MegaportTechTest

This is a simple sorting  console java application.
The input is a filename, for ex: "names.txt".
The contents of the file are names, in the format "KAREN, ANDREW". 
The program sorts all the names inside the file, and stores output to names-sorted.txt.
Supporting Junit tests are existing. 3 negative test cases and 1 positive test case has been drafted.

NOTE: The location of the input file should be modified. Line 24 of Megaport.java
has a file path, which needs to be changed in local machine
to run the program, else file not found exception will be the error thrown.
